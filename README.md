# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Neural Network

This project implements a **handwritten digit recognition system** using a **Neural Network** and the **MNIST dataset**. The model is trained to classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) based on pixel intensity values.

- The necessary libraries are `numpy`, `tensorflow`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `opencv`.
